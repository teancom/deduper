This script is used to de-duplicate emails between MailerLite lists, as
their built-in tools are lacking. Designed to run on any modern ruby with
no gem dependencies, it's mostly been tested on Mac OS 10.12 with ruby 2.4.
Testing and patches to make it work elsewhere, if necessary, would be gladly
accepted.
